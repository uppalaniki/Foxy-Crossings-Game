Foxy Crossings was inspired by the games Frogger and Crossy road. In 
this adaption, in level 1 (day mode) players control a fox trying to cross a 
busy road to reach safe zones. After the last safe zone, the fox will then 
encounter a river filled with moving logs, the fox needs to then use the moving 
logs to reach the end of level 1 to advance to level 2. In level 2 (night mode)
the fox must cross multiple busy roads and the twist here is that there are no 
safe zones after every road like level 1 resulting in the fox having to move 
continuously. The cars and logs will be moving much faster making it more 
difficult to reach the end of level 2
